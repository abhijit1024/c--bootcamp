// Array
- syntax
- array to store marks of a student and finds the avg
- array of strings that store the names of friends
- array of str that stores the phone numbers

// multi-dim array
- 2d array that represents a tic tac toe grid
- program that creates a n*n grid and fills it with val 
- given a grid of random numbers, convert each even number to 0
- given a grid, return the sum of each row and college
- given a grid, return a grid with rows reversed, i.e last row will be at 0th position etc

// function
- basic 
- square of number
- sqroot of number
- odd / even 

// function overloading
- default argument
- overloaded function that can print a string or int
- overloaded function that does a * n, a is default value
- overloaded function with multiple default values a and b, does a * b * n

// string
- convert int to string
- convert string to int
- print a complex number given real and img parts
- count no. of chars in a string
- count the occurrence of each chars
- palindromic string
  
// Decision
- odd / even detection
- if number > 100, then it is big else small
- palindromic number (prereq: reversing a number) [adv]

// Logical operators
- ||, &&
- print numbers divisible by 3 and 5
- print numbers divisible by either 3 or 7
- fizz buzz
  
// enum
- syntax
- enum for colors
- enum for t-shirt size
- enum for college year

// switch
- color detector
- Calculator (-, +, /, *) - using if else, switch

// Flow control
- prime number detection
- all even numbers
- nth fibonacci number
- 1st number whose sq < target
- reverse a number
- print star pattern
- x^n
- matrix multiplication [adv]

// Structure - Basic
- complex number and associated members
- user (name, email, phone) and associated members

// Class - Basic
- class library that asks for no. of books to hold and creates array of struct Books
- Calculator
- method chaining, class that stores an initial value. Then has methods that does 
 arithematic op like addTwo(), MultiplyBy4() on that value. The methods should be chainable
 i.e addTwo().MultipleByThree().addNum(4) 

// pointers
- create int, float ptr and modify their values using ptr
- given a ptr to an int, show the value
- given an array ptr, modify nth element
- modify fields of a struct given its obj ptr
- delete a ptr object
- ptr to string, change the odd position elements to 'x'

// new operator
- create ptrs - struct, Class
- delete class obj
- dynamically allocate a bigger array and move elements

// Structure/Class - array objects, fields
- struct student array to represents students
- struct classroom with struct student objects
- struct box (h, w, b), which can have more box objects as field

// constructor overloading
- student: c(name), c(name, phone), c(email)
- default constructor that prints the default values of its fields
- constructor with default phone value

// inheritance [adv]
- base class represents vehicle, children - 2 wheeler, 4 wheeler
- base pure abstract class Mammal with implmentations Bird, Land animal
- base abstract class
